# iOS-Libraries
This is the collection of small libraries I wrote mostly for convenience while I work on iOS projects. These small libraries has helped me tremendously, so I guess I want to share it to help other people. This may or may not suit your needs, so use it at your own disposal.

# How to use
Download this as zipped file or clone it to your project. This library contains Objective-C code as well as Swift code. If you're working with the Swift project, to include all the Objective-C code, you only need to create Objective-C bridging header and import the "CommonLibrary.h". All the Swift library will be automatically ready to use for you.
